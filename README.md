# Digit Recognition using a Neural Network

This repository was creating in hopes of understanding neural networks, more on the surface level than I was currently aware. The neural network i'm using is developed using tensorflow and takes inputs using the pygame framework, in order to render and draw different digits on the fly.

# Example:

You're able to draw onto the black canvas by right clicking and simply dragging your mouse.
**IMPORTANT** ==> You may need to wait several minutes in order for the model to train.

# Keys:
 C   => Clears the screen
 <br>
 ESC => Stops prediction and drawing capabilities

# Training the model:
  You can access the .env file in the file structure and change the EPOCHS variable in order to train a fresh model. Do not tamper with the MODEL_SHAPE nor delete the .env!

Of course this is no way near perfect, as with any neural model nor the greatest approach when trying to understand hand-drawn digits or even text.

You're free to pull requests and thread for issues and I'll be happy to help.
